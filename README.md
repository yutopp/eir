# EIR

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

EIR is a static optional type checker for BEAM files which are compiled by [tylang](https://github.com/yutopp/tylang).

It aims to analyze type discrepancy faster than [Dialyzer](http://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html). It will also alleviate processing resources used when type checking.
